  "question_statement_text": "A drop of water fell out of the cloud into the sea, and finding itself lost in such an immensity of fluid matter, broke out into the following reflection: \"Alas! What an inconsiderable creature am I in this prodigious ocean of waters. My existence is of no concern in the universe; I am reduced to a kind of nothing, and I am the least of the works of God\". It so happened that an oyster which lay in the neighbourhood of this drop chanced to gape and swallow it up in the midst of this soliloquy. The drop, say the fables, lay a great while hardening in the shell until by degrees it was ripened into a pearl, falling into the hands of a diver, after a long series of adventures, is at present that famous pearl which is fixed on the top of the Persian crown.",
